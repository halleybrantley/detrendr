\usage{
get_trend_windows(y, tau, lambda, k, window_size, overlap, max_iter,
  rho = 1, update = 10, use_gurobi = TRUE, eps_abs = 0.05,
  eps_rel = 0.001, scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{observed data}

\item{tau}{quantile levels at which to evaluate trend}

\item{lambda}{smoothing penalty parameter}

\item{k}{order of differencing}

\item{window_size}{size of windows to use}

\item{overlap}{integer length of overlap between windows}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations}

\item{rho}{parameter for ADMM}

\item{update}{number of iterations at which to print residuals}

\item{use_gurobi}{TRUE if gurobi solver is installed and should be used}

\item{eps_abs}{absolute threshold for stopping criteria}

\item{eps_rel}{relative threshold for stopping criteria}

\item{scale}{(TRUE/FALSE) scale response before estimating trend}
